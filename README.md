# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of Analysis
The aim of this project and analysis is to work toward future proofing our compnay Pewlett-Hackard. The current employee data indicates that in the near future the company will have a large number of employees who are eligible for retirement. In order to prepare for the wave of retirements that the compnay will experience our team has been asked to prepare a list that contains the number of employees who will be retiring from each department. Pewlett-Hackard is also proposing to create a mentorship program that will allow the retriring employees to mentor newly hired employees. In order to assess the feasability of such a project, another list containing the names of the eligible retiring employees was generated. 

## Results 
- The large majority of retiring employees are in the Senior Staff and Senior Engineer roles
- Only 2 managers will be eligible for retirement
